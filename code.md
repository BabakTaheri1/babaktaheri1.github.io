I enjoy animating basic concepts and here you can find some of the programs I've written.

### Power Systems

* [**Reactive Power-**](ReactiveTruck.html)<br>
This reactive power metaphor uses a truck-and-hill analogy to explain system efficiency. Active power is the useful work, shown as packages being delivered, while reactive power is the steepness of the hill, representing the wasted effort the truck must overcome.

* [**Reactive Power**](ReactiveParticle.html)<br>
This reactive power metaphor uses flowing particles to visualize electrical concepts. Useful active power is shown as blue particles moving directly to the load to perform work, while non-working reactive power is a turbulent orange or purple flow that just sloshes back and forth.
