I enjoy animating basic concepts and here you can find some of the programs I've written.

### Power Systems

* [**Reactive Power - Truck**](ReactiveTruck.html)<br>
This *reactive power metaphor* uses a truck-and-hill analogy to explain system efficiency. Active power is the useful work, shown as packages being delivered, while reactive power is the steepness of the hill, representing the wasted effort the truck must overcome.

* [**Reactive Power - Particle Flow**](ReactiveParticle.html)<br>
This *reactive power metaphor* uses flowing particles to visualize electrical concepts. Useful active power is shown as blue particles moving directly to the load to perform work, while non-working reactive power is a turbulent orange or purple flow that just sloshes back and forth.

### Math

* [**Polya's Urn**](Polya.html)<br>
This interactive tool simulates *Polya's Urn* üè∫, a classic probability model demonstrating the "rich-get-richer" phenomenon. In this model, drawing a colored ball from the urn increases the probability of drawing that same color in the future. You can adjust the rules for how many balls are added after each draw and run thousands of simulations to see how early random events can dramatically shape the final outcome.

* [**Euler's Identity**](Euler's_Identity.html)<br>
Euler's Identity, $e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$, often feels like a cryptic puzzle, a gathering of mathematics' most famous constants with no clear reason to be connected. How can the number for continuous growth, $e$, the soul of a circle, $\pi$, and the ghost in the machine, $i$, possibly combine with 1 to equal 0? The answer isn't a static fact, but the story of a dynamic journey. This visualization reveals that story, showing how constant "sideways growth" (the secret of $e^{i}$) for a precise distance ($\pi$) guides a point from a starting position of 1 to a final destination of -1. Click to see the beauty behind the world's most famous equation.
