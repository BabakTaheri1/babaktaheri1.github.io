I am a research scientist at <a href="https://www.hitachienergy.com/us/en" target="_blank">Hitachi Energy Research</a>.

<br />
I received my PhD in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology, and I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. <a href="https://molzahn.github.io" target="_blank">Daniel Molzahn</a>.

<br />

My passion lies in harnessing the power of mathematical optimization and machine learning techniques to foster a more reliable, resilient, affordable, and sustainable energy future. Outside of my work in research, I enjoy traveling, hiking, watching movies, and playing soccer and volleyball.
